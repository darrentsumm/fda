Directed by Dr. Eliana Christou and Dr. Wenyu Gao, I wrote these (mostly Machine Learning) models with the goal of predicting Systolic Blood Pressure based on Gender, Coronary Heart Disease, Age, BMI, and Activity (as a function). We used the CDC's NHANES dataset from 2011-2012 and 2013-2014, cleaned by Crainiceanu et al. Information on the cleaning process they conducted can be found here: https://functionaldataanalysis.org/dataset_nhanes.html

R code is posted in this repository, along with descriptions of each model in the commit messages. You can also find links to the corresponding HTMLs below and in the commit messages.
